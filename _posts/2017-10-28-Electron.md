01 - Electron
=============

Electron,  native  JS applications  or  something.
Regardless of  technology, everything needs  to be
hacked,  so learning  to break  and test  Electron
apps  needs to  happen.  With  tech borrowed  both
from  the web  and desktop  platforms, I'm  in the
dark with  this; where  to start, what  skills are
relevant, what tools exist.

Get together at the  first cracklab to discuss and
work on  reversing, inspecting,  and instrumenting
Electron apps, the new kid on the desktop block.

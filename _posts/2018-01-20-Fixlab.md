02 - Fixlab
===========
Eventually tools  break down or are  generally insufficient.
This  second craklab  session will  revolve around  building
and  extending tooling  for  testing  the contemporary  web.
Let's get  on with  topics around scripting,  extending, and
interfacing with existing security  testing tools as well as
speculating on ideas of tools  that are yet to be developed.
This is  not a  "proxy basics" workshop,  so be  prepared to
maybe set  up a  development environment  and write  code in
Python,  Javascript, Java,  or Ruby.  While the  workshop is
open to  any ideas around  tool development, we'll  at least
look at the scripting in ZAP and mitmproxy and the extension
interfaces  of Burpsuite  and  ZAP. Bring  a computer  your,
unfinished plugins, and the unpolished ideas.

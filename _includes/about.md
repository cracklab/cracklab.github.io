About
=====

Cracklab was born from a lack of hands-on computer security events in Helsinki.
Presentations and meetups seem to come and go but sitting down in a group and opening our laptops for more in-depth sessions seems rare.
Peer learning, decentralized organization, and solid technical content are the main goals of cracklab.

Peer learning
-------------
We try to move away from the presenter-audience model.
Instead we support a model where ideas come from single people but where everyone is responsible of contributing to the atmosphere of learning.
This doesn't mean every attendee needs to be a teacher, it just means that everyone is encouraged take initiative to ask and answer questions.

Decentralization
----------------
There are a few meetups that stopped happening simply because an admin is no longer active and no-one is able to take over the information channels.
Instead of creating something new when the old falls, we'd like there to be a possibility for anyone to take over the organizing of cracklabs.
This is the main reason all event planning and communication happens primarily on a public git repository.

Solid content
-------------
Topics will revolve around computer security, reverse-engineering, and the cyber.
In cracklab meetups subjects are ideally approached on a fundamental and practical level and time is given for people to understand and get excited about topics.
It's normal that coming up with solutions, finding information and debugging your code takes hours.
This will be visible and embraced at cracklab.
